## ☕️ Greetings!

I'm a full-stack developer based in Winchester, England. I use my love for art in my role by focusing on UI design and improving user experience.

🏒  I’m currently working on a [React application](https://github.com/Squiddymabob/nhl-app) that presents NHL scores and team data.

🦑  I'm currently playing around with a [personal website](https://github.com/Squiddymabob/personal-website) using Nuxt.js (Vue.js).

📚  I'm also working on a novel.
